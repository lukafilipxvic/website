I love listening to mixtapes. You get to find new songs that would be perfect for your playlist.

A problem that I had was not being able to instantly find songs in whatever platlist I was listening on my PC.

## **Who is Pyzam for?**
For DJs looking to integrate Shazam their set. For Daft Punk fans looking to find new samples. 

## **Secrets discovered**
Shazam can identify using a file that is up to 12 seconds long.
You can make Shazam requests of up to 20 times per minute.

If you have ffmpeg installed, try pyzam now:
```
pip install pyzam

pyzam --microphone
```
