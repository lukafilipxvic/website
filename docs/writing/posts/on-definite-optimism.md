Human beings have the ability to distinctly remember inflection points in their lives.

I remember a specific moment during my second year of college. I loved numbers, so I opted into studying finance, capital markets.

I sat down with myself to discuss my future: What can I do after I graduate? What value can I provide to society? What can I do to make my family proud?

I had nothing tangible.

I guarantee that I wasn't the only student that felt like this. Most colleges foster indefinite students, and I feel like I was one of them. Yet, it is not our fault. We go to college for a search of optimism and purpose, but many struggle to find either. 

That's where I put myself on a path to learn something valuable: programming.

That moment changed my life completely. It turned me from an indefinite observer into a definite doer. I could build my own dreams. 

Peter Thiel's **Zero to One** is a book that keep coming back to me. Whenever I read the it again, I unlock a new perspective. It's like knowledge is it's own language. It takes time to master. The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don't know. 

Definite optimists make the world better through certainty. They know where to go, how and why. Our world needs more of them. We need to give indefinite people the skills to become definite optimists and build the future of tomorrow, today.
